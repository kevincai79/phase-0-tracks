# Learn jQuery

- Search some doc. website and tutorial about jQuery.
- Test some code out so that I can better understand the knowledge I've just learned.
- Ask questions on slack for help if I get really confused.
- Take a break if I am stuck.

### After spending time studying, I found that reading tutorial plus test code by myself is the best way for me to understand the syntax. And taking a break if very important for me as well if I get stuck.
