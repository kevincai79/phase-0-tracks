# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Verson control allows us to view the entire history of revisions to one or more files, and merge revisions by different people. Version control help us to protect the project and make us work more efficient.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch in git gives a "copy" of your project to work on.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
Commit is the save points in Git. Acommit includes:
  * Aunique ID
  * A message
  * An author
  * A timestamp
 A good commit message would be a brief specific message about what has been updated. 

* What is a merge conflict?
When the changes at the same line in different branches or one branch attempt to change a file while it is deleted in another branch, this cause merge conflict.
